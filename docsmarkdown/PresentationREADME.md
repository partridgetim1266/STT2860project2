Final Presentation on Tuesday, December 7 @ 2pm IN ZOOM

1) Create your own R Markdown document.

   In the YAML header...
   
   * Choose an overall theme and highlight style for your document.
   * Use a coded date with (at least) year, month, day, hour, minute.
   * You may format your date/time however you choose, just be clear.
   * Include code folding, with the code hidden (like the other docs).
   
   Also include the `sessionInfo()` chunk at the end of your document.
   
2) Create a visualization using the `billionaires_2021_10_31` dataset.

   * Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/kkhandekar/billionaires-index
   * You may filter, mutate, whatever you would like to the variables.
   * Create one visualization that uses at least two of the variables.
   * In a few sentences, explain something about what your plot shows.
   
3) Create a visualization using an old or new datset that you choose.
  
   * You may revisit one of the class datasets to show something new.
   * You may use one of the publicly available datasets from DataCamp.
   * You may use one of the new datasets I put in the `dataraw` folder.
   * You may go to Kaggle or another resource and find your own data.
   * However, you MAY NOT use any of the datasets from Parts A and B.
   
   * Create one visualization from the dataset that you have chosen.
   * The plot must be new, not just a slight variation on previous work.
   * Explain why you chose the dataset you did---what interested you?
   * In a few sentences, explain something about what your plot shows.
   
You will both submit this document and use it to present to the class.
